# AI_Doodle_Dash
Shape Recognition with ResNet50

This project is a AI Doodle Dash! game where the goal is to recognize hand-drawn shapes using a deep learning model. The ResNet50 model is trained on a dataset of nearly 500,000 samples across five categories: triangle, circle, hexagon, star, and square.
In addition to the deep learning model, a Canny edge detection algorithm is employed to enhance the recognition accuracy by emphasizing the edges of the drawn shapes. The frontend of the game is created using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for players to draw and test the model's predictions.
The project is designed to be scalable, with the potential to expand and train on 144 categories of drawn shapes, making it an even more interesting game.
